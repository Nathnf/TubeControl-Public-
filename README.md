# TubeControl

This is a small project created by a beginner to develop an Android application to help people scrolling on YouTube. The purpose of this repository is to showcase what I have tried building.

The app will run in the background and check if YouTube is active in portrait mode with high activity levels. When appropriate, a pop-up will be displayed.
